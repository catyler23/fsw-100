                    <p>This title covers a larger range of skill sets / possible
                        roles. While it can refer to designing, building, and maintaining software and applications, but
                        it has
                        also been used when referring to web developers. Often using the term ‚Äúengineer‚Äù implies you
                        have a
                        deeper knowledge of Computer Science topics (such as data structures and algorithms).</p>

                    <h2> What is a Web Developer?</h2>
                    <p>As a general rule Web Developers primarily work with websites, as opposed to
                        building an application that would run on your computer (like Slack or Spotify, etc). If you are
                        a web
                        developer can imply being either a frontend, backend or full stack developer.</p>

        <aside id="developer"> Why you should become a developer?
            <p>As a developer you have the ability to create anything that comes to mind with only the help of a
                computer. The skill to code anything by learning programming languages. The possibility to turn
                ideas into reality. The freedom of thinking of something and being able to create it is
                unparalleled.</p>
